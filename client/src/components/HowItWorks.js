        <p className="p-4 has-text-centered">So, how does this work? I have a limited product range but always willing to try
        something new (feel free to contact me with any new ideas to look at) all items are
        lovingly and carefully handmade from repurposed timber. Each piece is unique, rustic
        and can be customised (within reasonable requests!) and has a uniqueness that
        comes with using scrap timber of all different shapes and sizes</p>
        <p className="pr-4 pl-4 pb-3 has-text-centered">The cost shown on the site is to purely to cover material costs and all that I ask, in
        addition to that, is that you consider making a suitable donation directly to the
        hospice at a level that you feel is appropriate to the item you have purchased to
        support such a worthy cause</p>
        <p className="pr-4 pl-4 pb-3 has-text-centered">Let’s just be clear on timescales, in the words of Leo Sayer, I’m a one-man band with
        limited equipment, space and time but as my friends, acquaintances and family
        members you’ll understand that things will not get completed overnight but they
        WILL get completed at some point</p>

      <div className="column">
        <p className="p-4 has-text-centered">As you will also appreciate “prime” delivery” is not an option and personal delivery is
        only possible for HP4 postcodes or you can collect from me. I don’t envisage
        spreading my wares across this great land but if you’re not local, please contact me
        to discuss “shipping and delivery” as I am sure we can figure this out between us</p>
        <p className="pr-4 pl-4 pb-3 has-text-centered">Thank you all for your support and consideration in helping an amazing charity.</p>
