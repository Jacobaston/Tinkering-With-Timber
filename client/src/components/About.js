          <p className="p-3">(Nod to my teenage daughter) I recently retired and whilst my lovely family,
          including the dog, keep me busy, I’ve discovered my love for tinkering with used
          timber, especially discarded pallets, which I reclaim from skips and waste piles
          around where I live.</p>
          <p className="pr-3 pl-3 pb-3">I enjoy many other things including cycling, watching Spurs (don’t hold that against
          me) and quietly helping others. So, I have decided to continue fundraising for The
          Hospice of St Francis in Berkhamsted but in a different way....and that’s where you
          come in.</p>
          <p className="pr-3 pl-3 pb-3">Any profit generated from you kind hearted folks willing to buy my wares goes
          directly to Hospice which will be gratefully received and genuinely makes a huge
          difference, the team there do an amazing job and frankly every little does help!</p>
